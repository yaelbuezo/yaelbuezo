Hi, I'm @yaelbuezo,

Something about my education and experience:

I've been taking some courses on platforms like Udemy and Coderhouse since august 2023. In these courses I've learned programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as tools like Sass and Cypress, including Node.js framework. Another course I took was MySQL Database Introduction. Since then, I've created a few web pages, shopping carts, among others. At the moment I am halfway through a Frontend Development Career on Coderhouse, while also learning C#.

Currently studying 'Carrera de Desarrollo Frontend React' on Coderhouse and 'Tecnicatura Universitaria en Programación Informática' in Universidad Nacional de Quilmes.
